# The NEWMAC Score Predictor - CSCI 160 Final

Team Members: Luke Sheldon, Henry Kuerbis, Amechi Aduba, Diego Marin, Mauro Perez Colon

The goal of this project was to use historical NEWMAC soccer data to train
machine learning models to predict the outcomes of an upcoming Clark Men's Soccer Conference
run. Specifically, we used a baseline model along with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,
and Random Forest Algorithms, comparing the accuracies of the different models.

A big part of our motivation for choosing this project was that we are all part of the Men's Soccer
Team at Clark, and have noticed first hand how statistics are having more of an impact on
the beautiful game than ever before.

Below are the final results:
